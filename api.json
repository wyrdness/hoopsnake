      "summary": "A legendary snake from American folklore that grabs its tail in its mouth and rolls like a wheel to chase prey at high speed, possessing a venomous tail stinger so deadly it can kill trees.",
      "full": "The Hoopsnake is a creature from American frontier and lumberjack folklore, described as a snake that takes its tail in its mouth and rolls like a wheel or hoop to pursue prey at great speed. According to the tales, it possesses a venomous stinger on its tail so deadly that when the snake stabs a tree while rolling, the tree dies instantly. The creature was said to roll downhill at tremendous velocity, making it nearly impossible to outrun. While primarily associated with fearsome critters, the hoopsnake legend was more widespread than typical lumberjack tales, appearing throughout American folklore from the 1800s through early 1900s. It has been thoroughly debunked - no snake species can physically perform this rolling behavior."
